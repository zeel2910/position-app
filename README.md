# position-app

This project is a template for creating your positioning web application/game.

This project was created using [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

This project uses the following frameworks and libraries, click the links for their documentations:

1. [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) / [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs): framework
2. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): CSS but (much) easier to use
3. [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): UI library based on TailwindCSS
4. [Svelte-Geolocation](https://github.com/metonym/svelte-geolocation): Geolocation API wrapper for Svelte
5. [Svelte-MapLibre](https://github.com/dimfeld/svelte-maplibre): MapLibre wrapper for Svelte

2. [Geolib: Library to provide basic geospatial operations](https://github.com/manuelbieh/geolib)

## Before use

1. This project uses JavaScript with type checking **disabled** to avoid excessive type engineering. This, however, leaves the application vulnerable to type-related errors. If you are a serious web developer, consider enabling JSDoc or using TypeScript for type checking.
2. Most of the information you will need for development can be found in the documentations of the involved libraries linked above.
3. Eslint is enabled by default, which will perform syntax and format checking. To take advantage of automatic formatting, use VSCode.
4. Lines with the comment `DoNotChange` should not be modified, unless you know what you are doing.

## Geolocation API

### Available positioning information

Geolocation API only provides latitudes and longitudes in desktop browsers. Altitudes are only available on smartphones. In addition, the `enableHighAccuracy` option will acquire more precise positioning using GNSS on smartphones if possible, which does not work on desktops.

### Use cases

There are two ways of using the Geolocation API, both are demonstrated in this template:

1. Obtaining the current position in a single request.
2. Watch the user position and update when it moves. The only difference in the code is to set `watch` to `true` in the `<Geolocation>` component.

You need to decide which one to use based your use cases, i.e., whether you only need to obtain the position once or track it continuously.

**Note that for the first option, some browsers, such as those Chromium based (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave), do not allow repeated Geolocation API requests when the position has not changed.** This means that making multiple such requests at the same location will result in timeouts or extremely long waiting in these browsers. **Firefox** does not have this limitation.

Nonetheless, if you are making repeated requests instead of using the `watch` option, you are probably doing it wrong!

## Prerequisites

1. Install `git` and set it up with your GitHub account.
2. Install the latest VSCode with at least the following plugins:
   1. ESLint
   2. Svelte for VS Code
   3. Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
3. Install the latest `node.js` and `pnpm`
   - If you understand the differences, you are free to replace `pnpm` with another package manager. Make sure to also replace `pnpm` in the commands below.
   - It is NOT recommended to modify the versions of the installed packages. If you are prompted by the package manager to upgrade old or "deprecated" packages, ignore.

## Developing

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account, **DO NOT** change the repository name `position-app`.

2. Clone the repository to your machine.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/position-app.git
    ```

3. In the project folder, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4. Start a development server and open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in a browser:

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

5. After modifying and validating code changes, add, commit and push to your remote repository:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "commit message"
    git push
    ```

## Deploying

1. Build project:

    ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```

2. Deploy project to GitHub pages:

    ```bash
    pnpm run deploy
    ```

3. Only after the first deployment, go to the repository settings on GitHub, then to the Pages tab. Select the `gh-pages` branch as the publishing source and click on Save.
4. Your web application will be available at _https://<your_username>.github.io/position-app/_ **after a few minutes**.
